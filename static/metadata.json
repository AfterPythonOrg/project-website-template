Accessing clean, ready-to-use data is a challenge, forcing traders to handle tedious data tasks before they can even start trading.\n\n## Solution\n`pfeed` leverages modern data engineering tools to centralize data cleaning efforts, automate ETL/ELT, store data in a **data lake with Delta Lake** support, and output **backtesting-ready data**, allowing traders to focus on strategy development.\n\n---\nPFeed (/pi\u02d0 fi\u02d0d/) is the data engine for trading, serving as a pipeline between raw data sources and traders. It enables you to **download historical data**, **stream real-time data**, and **store cleaned data** in a **local data lake for quantitative analysis**, supporting both **batch processing** and **streaming** workflows through streamlined data collection, cleaning, transformation, and storage.\n\n## Core Features\n- [x] Download or stream reliable, validated and **clean data** for research, backtesting, or live trading\n- [x] Get historical data (**dataframe**) or live data in standardized formats by just calling a **single** function\n- [x] **Own your data** by storing them locally using [MinIO] + [Deltalake], or in the cloud\n- [x] Interact with different kinds of data (including TradFi, CeFi and DeFi) using a **unified interface**\n- [x] Scale using modern data tools (e.g. [Polars], [Dask]) and workflow orchestration frameworks (e.g. [Prefect] for batch processing)\n\n---\n\n<details>\n<summary>Table of Contents</summary>\n\n- [Installation](#installation)\n- [Quick Start](#quick-start)\n    - [Get Historical Data in Dataframe](#1-get-historical-data-in-dataframe)\n    - [Download Historical Data](#2-download-historical-data)\n- [Supported Data Sources](#supported-data-sources)\n- [Related Projects](#related-projects)\n- [Disclaimer](#disclaimer)\n\n</details>\n\n\n\n## Installation\n> For more installation options, please refer to the [documentation](https://pfeed-docs.pfund.ai/installation).\n```bash\n# [RECOMMENDED]: Core Features, including MinIO, DeltaLake, Ray, Prefect, etc.\npip install -U \"pfeed[core]\"\n\n# add your desired data sources, e.g. databento, polygon, etc.\npip install -U \"pfeed[core,databento,polygon]\"\n\n# Minimal Features\npip install -U \"pfeed\"\n```\n\n\n\n## Quick Start\nCreate data feed object\n```python\nimport pfeed as pe\n\nbybit = pe.Bybit(data_tool='polars')\nfeed = bybit.market_feed  # this could be xxx.news_feed if the data source supports it\n```\n\n### 1. Get Historical Data in Dataframe\nGet [Bybit]'s data in dataframe, e.g. 1-minute data (data is downloaded on the fly if not found in storage)\n\n```python\ndf = feed.get_historical_data(\n    product='BTC_USDT_PERP',  # or BTC_USDT_PERPETUAL in full\n    resolution='1minute',  # '1tick'/'1t' or '2second'/'2s' etc.\n    start_date='2025-01-01',\n    end_date='2025-01-01',\n)\n```\n\n<details>\n<summary>See the first few rows of df:</summary>\n\n| date                | resolution   | product       | symbol   |    open |    high |     low |   close |   volume |\n|:--------------------|:-------------|:--------------|:---------|--------:|--------:|--------:|--------:|---------:|\n| 2025-01-01 00:00:00 | 1m           | BTC_USDT_PERP | BTCUSDT  | 93530   | 93590.8 | 93501.3 | 93590.5 |   30.284 |\n| 2025-01-01 00:01:00 | 1m           | BTC_USDT_PERP | BTCUSDT  | 93590.5 | 93627.7 | 93571.8 | 93625   |   30.334 |\n</details>\n\n> By using pfeed, you are just **one function call** away from getting a standardized dataframe\n\n\n### 2. Download Historical Data\nDownload historical data to the storage (e.g. local, MinIO, DuckDB etc.)\n```python\nfeed.download(\n    product='ETH_USDT_SPOT',\n    resolution='1s',  # 1-second data\n    rollback_period='1w',  # rollback 1 week\n    to_storage='local',\n)\n```\n\n\n\n## Supported Data Sources\n| Data Source          | Get Historical Data | Download Historical Data | Get Live Data | Stream Live Data |\n| -------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------ | --------------| ---------------- |\n| [Yahoo Finance]      | \ud83d\udfe2                  | \u26aa                        | \u26aa            | \u26aa               |\n| [Bybit]              | \ud83d\udfe2                  | \ud83d\udfe2                        | \ud83d\udfe1            | \ud83d\udd34               |\n| *Interactive Brokers | \ud83d\udd34                  | \u26aa                        | \ud83d\udd34            | \ud83d\udd34               |\n| *[FirstRate Data]    | \ud83d\udd34                  | \ud83d\udd34                        | \u26aa            | \u26aa               |\n| *[Databento]         | \ud83d\udd34                  | \ud83d\udd34                        | \ud83d\udd34            | \ud83d\udd34               |\n| *[Polygon]           | \ud83d\udd34                  | \ud83d\udd34                        | \ud83d\udd34            | \ud83d\udd34               |\n| [Binance]            | \ud83d\udd34                  | \ud83d\udd34                        | \ud83d\udd34            | \ud83d\udd34               |\n| [OKX]                | \ud83d\udd34                  | \ud83d\udd34                        | \ud83d\udd34            | \ud83d\udd34               |\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 = finished \\\n\ud83d\udfe1 = in progress \\\n\ud83d\udd34 = todo \\\n\u26aa = not applicable \\\n\\* = paid data\n\n\n\n## Related Projects\n- [PFund] \u2014 A Complete Algo-Trading Framework for Machine Learning, TradFi, CeFi and DeFi ready.
